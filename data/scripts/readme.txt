# To create a dataset, first assemble a list of the genes to include, and then run one of the python scripts using
# the following pattern. Note that the files must be in the directory where you run the python script. Replace
# the file names in angle brackets.

python assemble_dataset.py <the_phylip_files.list> -o <path_to_data/the_dataset.phy> --log <the_log.log>

# The R scripts are used to create lists of genes to include in each alignment
